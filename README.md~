# Compressible_Stratified

Hamiltonian DGFEM model for the motion of a compressible stratified fluid.

Documentation to follow shortly.

# Instructions
The code is found in the firedrake folder.

Once terminal console is in Firedrake mode, the code can be run by typing

python compressible_stratified.py

It will output in the console the time and energy drift for each timestep.


In the results folder, paraview compressible_stratified_results.pvd will provide visualisations of the flow.
Energy.txt contains the energy drift of the model at each timestep.




# MATLAB
